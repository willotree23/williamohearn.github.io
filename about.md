## About Will

I am a behavioral ecologist broadly interested in the evolution and ecology of social behavior particularly the nuances of partner choice in animals.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate working with Dr. Lauren Brent in the Center for Research in Animal Behavior at the university of Exeter, U.K. 

My research is on primate social cognition and behavior with a particular focus on macaques and baboons. I use long term data and field based experiments to investigate what primates know about one another and how they use that information to make adaptive social choices.
